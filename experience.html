            <h3>Undergraduate/Graduate Software Engineer</h3>
            <h4>Apadmi, September 2022 - Present</h4>
            <p>Apadmi is a mobile app development agency based out of Salford. They have a wide range of current and former clients in sectors including health, retail and loyalty, football, food delivery and telecommunications.</p>
            <p>I first started at Apadmi as an Undergraduate which was part of a year in industry I did as part of my degree. Since then I have been promoted to a graduate and had the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients and technologies. I've included some of my highlights below. Due to an ongoing non-disclosure agreement, I can't name clients directly on this page.</p>
            <h5>KMP Proof of Concept: <i>Kotlin, Swift, Jetpack Compose, Swift UI</i></h5>
            <p>One of my first projects at Apadmi was an internal proof of concept for the newly released technology Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (often referred to as KMM or KMP). The aim was to see how feasible it would be to implement and how well it worked.</p>
            <p>The way we did this was to take an already existing project, an app that allowed venues to book staff and performers for events and build a bare-bones version of it for both iOS and Android. KMP allows for developers to have common non-UI (business) logic with native UI so building both platforms was pivotal to to demonstrate the time savings.</p>
            <p>One of the major challenges I faced with this project was that I had never worked with Kotlin, Compose, Swift or Swift UI so had to learn them as I went. I think this went quite well as I picked it up quite quickly, my experience with Java Android apps helped with this but this was also the first time I had even worked with MVVM so there was a lot to learn.</p>
            <p>By the time the project had neared its end (about 2 months) I had managed to become quite versed in both languages with my most major accomplishment being creating an animated bar graph completely using native Swift UI.</p>
            <h5>Smart Bike Companion app: <i>Java, Kotlin, Swift, Jetpack Compose, XML, Swift UI, UIKit, Storyboards</i></h5>
            <p>This was my first full-time client project at Apadmi so I felt the pressure to perform. This client was quite a unique one for Apadmi as it was: firstly, an inherited and very dated code base; secondly, it was a very small team just a developer for each platform, a server developer and me; finally, the product owner worked for the client, not Apadmi.</p>
            <p>These all posed challenges such as the state of the code base made it very hard to work on, some commits were nearly ten years old in Java and others were done by Apadmi in Kotlin only a few weeks ago. This resulted in the code often being very hard to read especially for someone so early in their career. However, I believe being put on such a challenging project so early on shows how much I proved myself during my first few months.</p>
            <p>The product owner being from the client also introduced pressure on me having to meet with them often several times a day made me very nervous at first but I soon built up a great relationship with them. This ultimately resulted in me not only being trusted to be the sole Android developer on the project but also made responsible for completing a major brand refresh within the app for them.</p>
            <P>Although I mainly did Android work for this project I would often pick up some iOS development (mainly UIKit), especially during the time when I was working on introducing better analytics into the app through Firebase. Finally, while on the project I helped to integrate and launch a brand new subscription system for the app.</P>

            <h3>Senior Ambassador</h3>
            <h4>Calderstones School, September 2018 - April 2020</h4>
            <p>I got this role due to my previous work as a language leader for many years (see below). Myself and six others were responsible for choosing the members of and running the school council every year. We also planned, managed and staffed school events such as open days which regularly involved promoting the school to prospective parents. Moreover, we regularly attended meetings with high-level staff and governors at the school. Once a month, through this role, I was a member of a Liverpool council committee that was focused on the environment and safety in and around schools. We also ran some of the schools social media such as the school council's Twitter page.</p>

            <h3>Cyber Champion</h3>
            <h4>Merseyside Police, May 2019 - February 2020 </h4>
            <p>This was a city-wide project run my Merseyside Police and KPMG nad involved pupils from several different schools. We first took part in focused training where we learn all the concepts of cybersecurity that would be relevant to younger pupils. After this, we would occasionally take part in a day of running lessons where we went over these concepts.</p>

            <h3>National Citizens Service (NCS)</h3>
            <h4>Summer 2018</h4>
            <p>I worked as part of a team to plan and deliver a community program which raised over Â£500 for a mental health charity. This involved acquiring a location to hold the event and refreshments as well as working with the charity to coordinate the payment. While doing this I learned valuable teamwork and coordination skills.</p>

            <h3>Language Leader</h3>
            <h4>Calderstones School, January 2014 - April 2018</h4>
            <p>I worked as part of a smaller group of 4-5 other language leaders which was part of a large team with around 20-30 other subject leaders to plan and deliver topic-specific school-wide events. Planning included booking rooms and designing and distributing posters. Our particular group focused on delivering "Language Cafe" events which also included planning and communicating with the catering team about the food we wanted to be available during the event</p>
