            <h3>Senior Ambassador</h3>
            <h4>Calderstones School, September 2018 - April 2020</h4>
            <p>I got this role due to my previous work as a language leader for many years (see below). Myself and six others were responsible for choosing the members of and running the school council every year. We also planned, managed and staffed school events such as open days which regularly involved promoting the school to prospective parents. Moreover, we regularly attended meetings with high-level staff and governors at the school. Once a month, through this role, I was a member of a Liverpool council committee that was focused on the environment and safety in and around schools. We also ran some of the schools social media such as the school council's Twitter page.</p>

We first took part in focused training where we learn all the concepts of cybersecurity that would be relevant to younger pupils. After this, we would occasionally take part in a day of running lessons where we went over these concepts.</p>

This involved acquiring a location to hold the event and refreshments as well as working with the charity to coordinate the payment. While doing this I learned valuable teamwork and coordination skills.</p>

Planning included booking rooms and designing and distributing posters. Our particular group focused on delivering "Language Cafe" events which also included planning and communicating with the catering team about the food we wanted to be available during the event</p>
