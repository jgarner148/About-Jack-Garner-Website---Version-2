        </section>
        <section class="about_me_content">
            <p>I'm a 23-year-old developer who has just finished studying Software Engineering at Edge Hill University, graduationg with first class honours. I have been programming since secondary school where I started off by learning Python3.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of university, I started to learn HTML and CSS which I have used to make this website. I would describe myself as having a deep-rooted passion for technology, development, and solving problems.</p>
            <p>I started app development as part of my 'Mobile Apps' module at university learning how to make apps with Java and XML. Furthermore, as part of my undergrad and graduate roles I have learnt to develop apps for both iOS and Android in modern languages such as Kotlin and Swift as well as multi platform architectures such a React Native and Kotlin Mutliplatform Mobile (KMM/KMP).</p>
            <p>My experience in the industry has not only allowed me to learn these languages but also several industry standard tools such as Bitbucket and GitHub for pull requests, several different CI/CD platforms such as Bitrise, sprint management platforms such as Jira and Azure Dev Ops, analytics platforms like Firebase/Google Analytics and SCM tools like Github Desktop and Sourcetree.</p>
            <p>App accessibility is something I believe in very strongly, I think everyone should be able to use apps and experiences no matter their disability. Also, state-driven development is something I am very passionate about, I think that maintaining a great separation of concern between business logic and UI can lead to better maintainable adn therefore longer lasting apps.</p>

            <h3>Food Waste App</h3>
            <p>This was an app that I built as part of my final year project at university. It allows the user to better keep track of their food usage to reduce the amount of it they waste. The app achieved this by enabling the user to scan a receipt after they have done shopping and storing those items in a virtual 'cupboard'. This allowed the user to have a single place to see everything they had in stock</p>
            <p>Moreover, the app also allows the user to create and store recipes in the app and then add these recipes to a weekly calendar. This made it easier to plan what food you would need for that week to reduce the amount of unneeded food that they would purchase</p>
            <P>Finally, the app featured and articles section with the aim of educating the user on ways they can do better for the environment by reducing their wasted food.</P>

            <h3>Robot Juice</h3>
            <p>This website was built as part of my coursework for my web development module in the first year of my degree. It is a great demonstration of my HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills and is one of the most technically challenging sites that I have built. The website was built based on design documents that included screenshots of the layout and a colour palette.</p>
            <p>It uses JQuery to request different pieces of data from an API, such as the images and the user reviews, which involves JSON conversion.</p>
