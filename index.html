        <section class="about_me_content">
            <p>I'm a 19-year-old programmer who has just finished his first year studying Software Engineering at Edge Hill University. I have been programming since secondary school where I started learning Python3. Since the beginning of university, I have started to learn HTML and CSS as well as a bit of jQuery. These newly learned web coding skills are what I have used to make this website. Furthermore, I also began learning Java at Edge Hill which I am currently using in some of my projects. I would describe myself as having a deep-rooted passion for programming, computers, and how they work.</p>

            <p>This website was part of my coursework for my web development module in the first year of my degree. It is a great demonstration of my HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills and is one of the most technically challenging sites that I have built. The website was built based on design documents that included screen shots of the layout and a colour palette.</p>

            <h4>First version</h4>
            <p>I started working on this website to help me while learning HTML and CSS at university with the intention of using it as a way of showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers</p>
            <div class="git_button  img_central">

            </div>
            <h4>Second version</h4>
            <p>I started the development of this site once I had finished my first year of uni with the intention of making a more modern version of the original that incorporates things such as CSS transitions and animations that I learnt after building the first version.  Due to this being in early development, a GitHub link is currently unavailable.</p>

            <p>This is a project I have been working on since the beginning of 2020 as something to do during the first Coronavirus lockdown. Since then I have finished the first version of the project and have started on the second</p>
            <h4>First Version</h4>
            <p>This version was written in Python3 and is text-based. The original aim with this version was to have an automatic and a manual mode that incorporated different versions of a basic AI. However, after the manual version was built the automatic version was not added and will instead be added to version 2.</p>

            <h4>Second Version</h4>
            <p>This version is being built in Java and is currently only in the early stages of development. The aim is for this to be a full graphical user interface with plans to make static cartoon images that will be collated into a comic-style page. Due to this being in early development, a GitHub link is currently unavailable.</p>
