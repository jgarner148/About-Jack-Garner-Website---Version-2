        <section class="about_me_content">
            <p>I'm a 23-year-old developer who has just finished studying Software Engineering at Edge Hill University, graduationg with first class honours. I have been programming since secondary school where I started off by learning Python3. </p>
            <p>I started app development as part of my 'Mobile Apps' module at univesity learning how to make apps with Java and XML. Furthermore, as part of my undergrade and graduate roles I have learnt to develop apps for both iOS and Android in modern languages such as Kotlin and Swift as well as multi platform architectures such a React Native and Kotlin Mutliplatform Mobile (KMM/KMP).</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of university, I started to learn HTML and CSS which I have used to make this website. I would describe myself as having a deep-rooted passion for technology, development, and solving problems.</p>

            <h4>First version</h4>
            <p>I started working on this website to help me while learning HTML and CSS at university with the intention of using it as a way of showcasing my skills and projects to potential employers</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Second version</h4>
            <p>I started the development of this site once I had finished my first year of uni with the intention of making a more modern version of the original that incorporates things such as CSS transitions and animations that I learnt after building the first version.  I would like to work on it more in the future but I have recently updated it with my current experience.</p>

            <h3>Childrens Story Box</h3>
            <p>This is a project I have been working on since the beginning of 2020 as something to do during the first Coronavirus lockdown. Since then I have finished the first version of the project and have started on the second</p>
            <p>This was written in Python3 and is text-based. The original aim with was to have an automatic and a manual mode that incorporated different versions of a basic AI. However, after the manual version was built the automatic version was held of for a future iteration of the project.</p>

            <h3>Robot Juice</h3>
            <p>This website was part of my coursework for my web development module in the first year of my degree. It is a great demonstration of my HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills and is one of the most technically challenging sites that I have built. The website was built based on design documents that included screen shots of the layout and a colour palette.</p>
